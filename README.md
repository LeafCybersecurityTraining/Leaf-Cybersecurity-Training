# Leaf-Cybersecurity-Training

This project represents a practical view of a cyber range design. 

It provides an example of platform for cybersecurity training, in which several cyber scenarios can take place.

Hardware requirements: RAM 6 GB, CPU I-5, Graphic 512 MB.

VirtualBox settings: File -> Preferences -> Network -> Add a network -> NetNetwork -> Edit network with Nat in the CIDR Network change and put 192.168.100.0/24 and "support" check if DHCP is required.

The machines must be imported exactly in this order:
1.	router.range1.cyber
2.	router.blue.cyber
3.	www1.blue.cyber
4.	mail.blue.cyber
5.	ws1.range1.cyber

After loading the machines you have to start them in the same order.
